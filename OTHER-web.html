    <h1>Link to all webs made</h1>
    <p>These are links to all the websites that I have made over the term.</p>
    <p>Most of these show my thoughts with where I was initially planning to take the website and others I made at the very beginning where I was learning to code.</p>

            <h3>The Y2K Website</h3>
            <a href="Y2Kweb.html" target="_blank">Y2K web</a>
            <p>The idea for this website was for the theme to be Y2K 2000s. I haven't finished it and idk if I will, but it now doesn't fit the idea of my website and is being rejected.</p>

            <h3>Swirlie Wirls</h3>
            <a href="ChenInspo.html" target="_blank">Swirlie Wirl web</a>
            <p>I was inspired by Chen Ching-Lungs' <i>Feng Xin Yi Cheng Jue Di Zhen Hui</i> work which is acrylic on a canvas.</p>
            <p>When viewing this image I knew that I wanted to make a website page that would have lots of colourful lines. What I enjoyed most about Chen Ching-Lung work was the colours and the movement of the piece. I wanted to recreate this in the form of moving lines.</p>

            <h3>Eating Muffin</h3>
            <a href="hobbyWebsite.html" target="_blank">hobby web?</a>
            <p>I dont think that the 'iframe' live feature works best for this website.</p>

            <p>ChatGPT website.</p>

            <h3>Research?</h3>
            <a href="research.html" target="_blank">research web?</a>
            <p>This website was the 'research' for the draft number one website - it was really bad - the things here didn't work well together and most cool things were javascript which I didn't code myself</p>

            <iframe src="PrettyWeb.html"></iframe>
            <h3>Pretty Web?</h3>
            <a href="PrettyWeb.html" target="_blank">Pretty web?</a>
            <p>To practise my coding i made this website. I also thought it would be fun to code certain things and then have a screenshot of the code and a explaintion for it - I got bored of this quickly but it was fun.</p>
