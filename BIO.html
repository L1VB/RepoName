        <h3></h3>
        <p>Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle, Washington in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the dissolution of Nirvana after the death of Kurt Cobain. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as "foo fighters". Over the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album. As of 2015, the band have sold 12 million copies in the United States alone.</p>

        <h3>Music Style</h3>
        <p>When Grohl first started the band, its music was often compared to that of his previous group, Nirvana. Grohl acknowledged that Nirvana singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, “Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that’s stripped down.” Foo Fighters also utilize the Pixies’ technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud chorus, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana “liking the Knack, Bay City Rollers, The Beatles, and Abba as much as we liked Flipper and Black Flag, I suppose”. Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar similar to how he approached playing a drumkit, assigning different drum parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, “I could hear the song in my head before it was finished.” Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song arrangements.</p>
        <p>The members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with harder sounds. Grohl noted in 1997, “We all love music, whether it’s the Beatles or Queen or punk rock. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we’re all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural.”</p>
